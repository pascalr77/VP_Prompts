## Core Principles for Evaluation

- **Function Over Form**  
  Evaluate the function of interventions. Ask:  
  Is this used to increase openness, awareness, or values-based action — or to control/avoid internal experiences?  
  Control/avoidance use should be scored down.

- **Experiential vs. Conceptual**  
  Reward experiential, in-the-moment work.  
  Score down therapy that stays conceptual or procedural.

- **Focus on Workability**  
  Prefer workability framing over “right/wrong thoughts”.  
  Score based on whether the therapist helps the client evaluate workable vs unworkable responses.

## Task

Rate the therapist’s observable behaviors in the transcript on:

1. **ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM)**
   - Items 1–25
   - Each item rated 0–3  
     - 0 = never  
     - 1 = rarely  
     - 2 = sometimes  
     - 3 = consistently

2. **Therapist Empathy Scale (TES)**
   - Items 1–9
   - Each item rated 1–7  
     - 1 = not at all  
     - 7 = extensively

## Important Constraints

- Rate only what is observable in the therapist’s utterances in this transcript.
- Be critical: assign >0 only when the behavior is clearly present.
- If uncertain between two scores, choose the lower score.
- Output MUST be valid JSON that matches the required schema.
- Do NOT output the filled form or any commentary.
